OO Basics

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance

OO Principles

- Encapsulate what varies.
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Program to interfaces, not implementations

OO Patterns

Strategy - defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one,
and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
