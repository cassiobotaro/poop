"""
Notes:
    - useful in creating product families, example custom cheese pizza
      from new york
      that is, the pizzas created are of the same quality,
      but the flavor varies according to the factory and
      the ingredients are different
    - one thing i noticed is that with this abstraction the chicago cut which
      was square didnâ€™t remain
    - each store depends on the abstraction of a factory of ingradientes and
      not something concrete
    - the create_pizza method is a method that behaves
      like a factory (factory method)
    - the PizzaStore type has the factory method that is implemented depending
      on an abstraction of the ingradients factory (see NYPizzaStore)
      which in turn uses a method as a factory that depends on
      abstractions of each of the ingredients ðŸ¤¯
    - UnknownPizza implements the abstraction of a Pizza,
      eliminating several if's in the implementation
