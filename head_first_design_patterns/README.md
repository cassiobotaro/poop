# HEAD FIRST: DESIGN PATTERN

## OO Basics

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance

## OO Principles

- Encapsulate what varies.
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Program to interfaces, not implementations
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

## OO Patterns

**Strategy** - defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one,
and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

**Observer** - defines a one-to-many dependency between objects
so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are
notified and updated automatically.

**Decorator** - Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
